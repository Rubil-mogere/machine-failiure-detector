### 1. Machine Learning Algorithm

**Decision Tree:**
- Reasoning: Decision trees are suitable for this task due to their interpretability, ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, and capacity to capture complex relationships in sensor data. Decision trees provide a transparent view of the decision-making process, which is valuable in understanding the factors contributing to equipment failures.

### 2. Relevant Features:

**Sensor Data:**
- Vibration Levels: Changes in vibration can indicate machinery stress.
- Temperature: High temperatures may signal issues with cooling systems.
- Pressure: Abnormal pressure might suggest problems in the manufacturing process.
- Power Consumption: Unusual power patterns could point to inefficiencies or impending failure.

### 3. Handling Missing Data and Outliers:

- For simplicity, the code uses mean imputation for missing values and winsorization for handling outliers in the sensor data. This is a basic approach; more sophisticated methods could be employed based on the characteristics of the data.

### 4. Integration into Manufacturing Process:

- The script concludes by simulating integration into the manufacturing process. It checks for updates, monitors temperature, processing speed, and power usage. It also prints a warning if an equipment failure is predicted. In a real-world scenario, this integration would involve setting up a system for real-time monitoring and scheduling maintenance based on the model predictions.
